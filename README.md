### Simple implementation of "Interpolation Search" algorithm  
----
#### Steps:  
                
1. Start searching data from middle of the list.
2. If it is a match, return the index of the item, and exit.
3. If it is not a match, probe position.
4. Divide the list using probing formula and find the new midle.
5. If data is greater than middle, search in higher sub-list.
6. If data is smaller than middle, search in lower sub-list.
7. Repeat until match.
